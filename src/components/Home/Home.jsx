            Hi, I’m Tia Piol. I'm an Army Veteran with over 14 years of experience in Information Technology, with the last five focused on cybersecurity. My background includes risk management, system administration, and compliance work supporting organizations like the Department of State and the U.S. Army. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in securing systems, improving performance, and ensuring compliance with NIST and FISMA standards.</p>

          <p>
            With a solid foundation in cybersecurity, expanding into software engineering felt like a natural progression for me. I enrolled in General Assembly’s Software Engineering Bootcamp to sharpen my technical abilities and gained real, practical experience in full-stack development. I built applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and Express.js, integrating RESTful APIs and implementing client/server routing. This experience strengthened my ability to design and develop secure, scalable applications from the ground up.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal is to blend my cybersecurity expertise with my growing development skills to create applications that are both innovative and secure. I enjoy problem-solving, learning new technologies, and finding creative ways to make systems better.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of work, I love to travel, mentor others who are transitioning into tech, and keep pushing myself to learn and grow—both personally and professionally.
