            Hi, I’m Tia Nicole Piol. I have over 14 years of experience in Information Technology, with the last five focused on cybersecurity. My background includes risk management, system administration, and compliance work supporting organizations like the Department of State and the U.S. Army. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in securing systems, improving performance, and ensuring compliance with NIST and FISMA standards.</p>

          <p>
            Even with my cybersecurity background, I’ve always had a genuine interest in software engineering and coding. This year, I decided to finally go for it and enrolled in General Assembly’s Software Engineering Bootcamp. There, I learned full-stack web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and Express.js. I also worked with RESTful APIs, React Router, Express routing, and Git/GitHub version control. The program gave me the hands-on experience I wanted to build functional, secure, and user-friendly applications from the ground up.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal is to blend my cybersecurity expertise with my growing development skills to create applications that are both innovative and secure. I enjoy problem-solving, learning new technologies, and finding creative ways to make systems better.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of work, I love to travel, mentor others who are transitioning into tech, and keep pushing myself to learn and grow—both personally and professionally.
